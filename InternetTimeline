# Brief history of the Internet
1957 - USSR launched Sputnik into space which allowed global communications.
1961 - Leonard Kleinrock pioneered packet-switching at MIT in his doctoral thesis.
1962 - J.C.R. Licklider wrote memos about Intergalactic Network concepts of networked computers.
1963 - American Standard Code for Information Exchange (ASCII) is developed.
1964-1967 - Paul Baran & Donald Davies develop Message blocks/packet-switching.
1965 - Lawrence Roberts & Thomas Marill create the first Wide-area Network(WAN)
1966 - ARPAnet Project initiated (the foundation of today's Internet).
1967 - First ARPAnet design paper was lead and published by Lawrence Roberts. Were called IMPs, but today, routers.
1967 - Donal Davies published first Packet-switching paper.
1967 - First real-time visual flight simulator on a general purpose computer was developed (led to computer graphics
       line clipping algorithms.
1968 - Hypertexting and collaborative computing was introduced by Engelbart
1968 - BBN is awarded the ARPA contract to build the Interface Message Processors.
1968 - Host level protocols for ARPAnet communications were developed at UCLA (laid foundation for protocols of the
       modern Internet.
1969 - The physical Interface Message Processor (IMP) network is made, linking 4 nodes.
1969 - First data packets were sent by UCLA team.
1970-1979 - Dr. David Clark implemented Internet protocols for the Multics systems, the Xerox PARC ALTO and the IBM PC.
1970 - Peter Kirstein started European ARPAnet.
1972 - IMP Network grew to fifteen nodes (23 hosts).
1972 - The Email program to send message across a distributed network was invented by Ray Tomlinson of BBN.
1972 - John Postel helps create first Internet address registry, which later becomes Internet Assigned Number Authority
       (IANA), who administer IP addresses.
1973 - Ethernet was created at Xerox Parc.
1973 - Development of TCP/IP begins, which allowed diverse computer networks to interconnect and communicate with
       each other.
1973 - First international ARPAnet Link was made.
1974 - Elizabeth Feinler begins to help lead SRI International’s Network Information Center (NIC), where her group
       eventually develops the first Internet “yellow-” and “white-page” servers, the first query-based network host
       name and address (WHOIS) server, and the Host Naming Registry for the Internet. As a part of this effort she
       and her group develop the top-level domain naming schemes of .com, .edu, .gov, .mil, .org, and .net.
1974 - The term "Internet" was used for first time in Vint Cerf & Robert Kahn publication.
1974 - A commercial version of ARPAnet, Telenet.
1977 - Lawrence Landweber created Computer Science Network (CSNET).
1980-1989 - Radia Perlman designs IS-S (Intermediate System to Intermediate System) protocol for routing IP, which
        continues to be used today, and the Spanning Tree algorithm, which allows the Ethernet to handle large clouds
        of data.
1980 - Mike Jensen begins building some of the earliest networks to connect the nonprofit sector, playing a key role
       in establishing network connectivity for developing countries.
1980 - Jaap Akkerhuis Helps Connect the Netherlands and Europe, setting stage for global connectors.
